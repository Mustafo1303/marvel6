        <p>Who is Nick Fury? Nick Fury is a former Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., founder of the Avengers, master martial artist, and expert combatant. He is also a master strategist and astute judge of character, using these talents for great effect in his leadership of S.H.I.E.L.D..
            <br> <span> Nicholas Joseph (Nick) Fury[1] is a fictional character portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Prior to the formation of the MCU, Marvel Comics incorporated Jackson's likeness into the reimagined design of the character for The Ultimates. In the MCU, Fury is initially depicted as a master spy who is the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Fury enacts the Avengers Initiative in response to Loki's invasion of Earth, a plan he previously developed after meeting Carol Danvers and learning of extraterrestrial threats.

            Following the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. and his near fatal encounter with the Winter Soldier, Fury fakes his death and hunts down Hydra cells before assisting the Avengers in their battle against Ultron. Fury falls victim to the Blip, and upon his resurrection dedicates his time to developing the S.A.B.E.R. intergalactic defense space station until being called back to Earth in an effort to thwart the invasion of a rogue group of Skrulls.
            
            As of 2023, Fury has appeared in eleven MCU films, beginning with an appearance in the post-credits scene of Iron Man (2008). He also appeared in two episodes of the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013â€“14). He stars as the protagonist of the miniseries Secret Invasion (2023).
            
            Alternative versions of Fury from the MCU multiverse appear in the animated series What If...? (2021), with Jackson reprising the role.
